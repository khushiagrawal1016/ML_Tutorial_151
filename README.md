Algorithms Implemented:

K-means Clustering:
K-means clustering is implemented using the Lloyd's algorithm, which iteratively assigns data points to the nearest cluster centroid and updates the centroids based on the mean of the assigned points. The process continues until convergence, where centroids no longer change significantly or a maximum number of iterations is reached. The algorithm aims to minimize the within-cluster variance, effectively partitioning the data into K distinct clusters.

Logistic Regression:
Logistic Regression is implemented using gradient descent or other optimization techniques to find the optimal coefficients that define the decision boundary separating the classes in the feature space. The algorithm computes the probability that a given input belongs to a certain class using the logistic function, which maps the output to the range [0, 1]. During training, the model adjusts the coefficients to minimize the logistic loss function, ultimately achieving a good fit to the training data for binary classification tasks.

Multiple Linear Regression:
Multiple Linear Regression is implemented using ordinary least squares (OLS) method or other optimization techniques to estimate the coefficients that best fit a linear relationship between multiple predictor variables and a continuous target variable. The algorithm computes the predicted target variable based on the weighted sum of the predictor variables, where the weights are the estimated coefficients. During training, the model adjusts the coefficients to minimize the mean squared error between the predicted and actual target values.

Random Forest Classifier:
Random Forest Classifier is implemented as an ensemble of decision trees, where each tree is trained on a random subset of the training data and a random subset of the features. During training, each tree learns to predict the class label based on the feature values. The final prediction is determined by aggregating the predictions of all the trees through voting (classification) or averaging (regression). The algorithm is robust to overfitting and often provides high accuracy by reducing variance and capturing complex relationships in the data.

Support Vector Machine (SVM):
Support Vector Machine is implemented using optimization techniques to find the optimal hyperplane that separates the classes in the feature space with the maximum margin. The algorithm works by transforming the input data into a higher-dimensional space using kernel functions, where a hyperplane is then constructed to maximize the margin between the closest data points of different classes. During training, the model adjusts the parameters to minimize the classification error and maximize the margin, resulting in a robust decision boundary capable of handling nonlinear relationships in the data.

This project provides an insightful exploration into various machine learning algorithms, including K-means clustering, Logistic Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, Random Forest Classifier, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). By implementing and analyzing these algorithms, users gain a deeper understanding of their strengths, weaknesses, and applications in real-world scenarios.
